# Information-theoretic-early-warning-signals-of-mathematical-insight
This repository includes R Markdown scripts for a project that investigates the underlying mechanisms of creative mathematical insights to better understand, promote, and predict such creative efforts. This projects consists of two parts: a formal model of mathematical insights and an empirical study that validates the model findings. 

In this repository, you can find the following R Markdown scripts:

1- Model with increasing measures

2- Model with fixed measures

3- Code for the energy landscape plots

4- Empirical data analysis (the corresponding data files can be found in the same repository)

Currently, the research team is preparing a manuscript of this project for publication. Here is a summary of the project and its results:

Mathematical discovery is a paragon of human creativity but remains shrouded in mystery. Mathematicians describe their insights as unpredictable, arriving like a “flash of lightening”. These insights have the hallmarks of critical transitions or tipping points in a complex dynamical system. The onset of these insights remains poorly understood, however, and existing methods for analyzing and predicting critical transitions are ill suited for the messy, multi-modal, symbolic nature of mathematical practice.
Here, we show that real-world insights among mathematical experts are prefigured by a system-agnostic information-theoretic early warning signal. In a video corpus of mathematicians working on proofs in ecologically-valid settings (i.e., at chalkboards in their own departments), we quantified the moment-to-moment dynamics of their embodied interactions (i.e., writing, gesturing). We then investigated whether an entropy-based early warning signal derived from the mathematicians’ embodied dynamics could predict the onset of sudden, “eureka” insights. We first illustrate our approach with a minimal dynamical model of insight. We show that, in this minimal model, the entropy-based early warning signal can detect the loss of resilience in the latent dynamics of understanding, thus allowing us to predict the onset of insights. We then show that this signal also predicts the onset of real-world, “eureka” insights among actual mathematicians. Starting nearly two minutes before insights that, on the surface, appeared to occur suddenly, we find a systematic increase in the entropy of the dynamics of mathematicians’ embodied interaction with the blackboard. By shifting our focus to the larger distributed system from which mathematical insights emerge — a system that includes mathematicians’ bodies and inscriptions — we can predict the onset of insight. Embodied interactions can thus foreshadow, and may even drive, sudden and transformative conceptual change.
